# 2048 Game

A modern implementation of the classic 2048 sliding puzzle game built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. This project features responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## üéÆ How to Play

### Desktop

- Use the **arrow keys** (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move all tiles on the board
- When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one with their sum
- Create a tile with the number 2048 to win!

### Mobile

- **Swipe** Up, Down, Left, or Right to move tiles
- The same merging mechanics apply as on desktop

## ‚ú® Features

- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile
- Touch controls for mobile devices
- Keyboard controls for desktop
- Score tracking
- Game over detection
- New game functionality
- Smooth animations

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface
- **TypeScript**: For type safety
- **Vite**: As the build tool and development server
- **Styled Components**: For styling
- **Context API**: For state management

## üìù Game Logic

The game maintains a 4x4 grid of numbers. When a move is made:

1. All tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction
2. Tiles with the same value merge when they collide
3. A new tile (either 2 or 4) appears in a random empty cell
4. If no valid moves are possible, the game ends
